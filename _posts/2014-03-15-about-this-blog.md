I started this blog to note some of my thoughts around the field of [web operations](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0043M4Z34/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B0043M4Z34&linkCode=as2&tag=weop05-21) and technology in general.

### Who am I?

I'm a technologist, currently working for the UK [Government Digital Service](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/) as a [web operations engineer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLR1LnxplAY). In the past I've worked as a PHP developer, frontend designer and commercial photographer.

I should clarify that the views expressed here are my own and not those of my employer.

### How is this site built?

I'm glad you asked.

This site runs on static HTML generated by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), hosted by [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) and served via [Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/) to a POP near you.

To make changes to this blog, I simply create a new text file in [this Github repository](https://github.com/mattbostock/mattbostock.github.io). The text files are formatted in [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and use [frontmatter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) YAML headers for the page metadata. [Github](https://github.com/) then kindly generates the pages that you see before you.
